# Bits and Bytes

## Bits

A bit is the smallest unit of storage in a computer.

A bit can store either a 1 or a 0.

Physically it is storing the "electrical state" (there's probably a better term for that) of on (1) or 0 (off).

## Bytes

A byte is comprised of 8 bits.

One byte can store one character.
