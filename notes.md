The only thing that a computer can store is bytes.

To store something in a computer, you must first encode it.

Text can be encoded in many formats, like ASCII or UTF-8.

In Python, a byte string is a sequence of bytes. It isn't human readable.

(Remember that the only thing a computer can store is bytes.)

A character string, on the other hand, is a sequence of characters. It is human readable.

A character string can't be directly stored on a computer. It must be encoded first.

(Encoding = converting to a byte string)
